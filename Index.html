        <h2>Welcome to my Website</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Muhsin Abdirizak, This is my first Website and I'm very proud of it.<br>
             I've been learning Html and Css since the start of February 2024,<br>
              now it is the 14th of February,<br>
               and i'm happy to say that this website is finally complete. </p><br>

        <h2>What skills do I have?</h2>
        <P>I've mastered Html and a good amount of Css,<br>
             although I still have a long way to go,<br>
              because I still don't understand Javascript but inshaallah I will learn it in time.<br>
              I also have to learn more about Css but atleast i can style my webpage nicely,<br>
               I also plan to learn React and maybe PHP in the future. :)</P><br>

        <img src="Screenshot 2024-02-14 194521.png" alt="My previous projects" width="500px" class="nul">
        <p>In only four days, I was able to make a sign up, login page,and a password recovery page.<br>
             It is safe to say that I've mastered html forms,although<br>
               I don't know any php or msql so they data goes no where,<br>
                but i plan on fixing that.<br>
                 hopefully i can improve my skills and remix this Website in the future. :) </p><br>
